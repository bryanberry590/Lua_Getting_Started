# Lua_Getting_Started

This is a test program with two separate class files and a main file that uses the classes.

This is setup to show you how classes are created and how to import them to other files.
The main class also goes in depth with on inheritance in lua and you'll see how it differs from other common languages.

To run this, make sure you have lua installed:
    Mac: brew install lua

Then navigate to the project directory and run:
    lua main.lua 

You will see the output from the main.lua file
